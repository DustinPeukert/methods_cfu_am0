# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I feel most proud about completing the final_practice.rb exercises without getting stuck on anything
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods allow us to save on time and space by calling repeatedly on the same chunk of code whenever we need it instead of rewriting it over and over
